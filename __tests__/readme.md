## Are you and your (prospective) partner of suitable age to date?

When you walk down the street holding hands, will people stop and say #oh my what a cute couple# or will they shriek **Egad! What's that old creep doing with that child** or **Hey, check out the gold digger and the old bugger**? Will your friends call you a **Cradle Robber** - and not even pretend to be joking?

Fear not! Now, with the #Age Ratio Calculator#, you can just simply enter the ages of your prospective partner and yourself, and the calculator will objectively let you know if the relationship will be regarded as wholesome or creepy.

If the age difference is in the creepy range, the kindly and considerate calculator will tell you how long you should wait until the age relative difference evaporates - for true love does not rust, so if the love is real you can wait out the creep factor and hook up at a later date. (COMING SOON)

## Half plus seven

The calculator is based on the universal dating rule "Half plus seven", which means that the youngest partner must be at least half the age plus seven years of the age of the oldest parter. So a 20 year old person can date a 17-year-old... but not a 16-year old. [That would be icky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships).
